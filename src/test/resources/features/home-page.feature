Feature: Multi-player
  MC is a multi-player game. It should be easy for players to find each other using MC servers.

  Scenario: Potential player accesses an MC server using a web browser and a DNS name
    Given the DNS name, example.com, of an MC server
    When the potential player gives the DNS name to a web browser
    Then the MC server redirects to the home-page

  Scenario: Potential player accesses an MC server using a simple URL with the root path
    Given the DNS name, example.com, of an MC server
    When the potential player gives the obvious URL http://example.com/ to a web browser
    Then the MC server redirects to the home-page

  Scenario: Potential player accesses an MC server using the URL of the home-page
    Given the DNS name, example.com, of an MC server
    When the potential player gives the home-page URL to a web browser
    # The home-page URL is http://example.com/home
    Then the MC server serves the home-page
