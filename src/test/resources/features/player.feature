Feature: Player
  Mission Command is a multi-player game.
  To conserve resources, play on a server is restricted to only known (and presumably trusted) users.

  Scenario: Get players resource of fresh instance
    Given a fresh instance of MC
    When getting the players resource
    # The path of the players resource is /player
    Then MC serves the resource
    # And there is only one player, the administrator, with the default name
    And the response is a list of players
    And the response is a singleton list of players
    And the list of players includes the administrator
    And the list of players includes a player named "Administrator"
