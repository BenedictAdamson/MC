Feature: User
  Mission Command is a multi-player game.
  To conserve resources, play on a server is restricted to only known (and presumably trusted) users.

  Scenario: Get users of fresh instance
    # Implicitly a fresh instance of MC
    Given logged in as "<name>"
    And user "<name>" has the "player" role
    When getting the users
    Then MC serves the resource
    And the response is a list of users
    And the list of users has at least one user
    
    Examples:
      |name|
      |John|
      |Jeff|
    
  Scenario Outline: Login
    # Implicitly not logged in
    Given that user "<user>" exists with  password "<password>"
    When log in as "<user>" using password "<password>"
    Then MC accepts the login
    
    Examples:
      |user|password|
      |John|letmein|
      |Jeff|pasword123|
    
  Scenario Outline: Add user
    Given logged in as "<name>"
    And user "<name>" has the "user-admin" role
    When adding a user named "<new-name>" with  password "<password>"
    Then MC accepts the addition
    And can get the list of users
    And the list of users includes a user named "<new-name>"
    
    Examples:
      |name|new-name|password|
      |Andrew|John|letmein|
      |Zoes|Jeff|password123|
    
  Scenario Outline: Only administrator may add user
    Given logged in as "<name>"
    And user "<name>" does not have the "user-admin" role
    Then MC does not present adding a user as an option
    
    Examples:
      |name|new-name|password|
      |John|Jeff|letmein|
      |Jeff|John|password123|
