Feature: User
  Mission Command is a multi-player game.
  To conserve resources, play on a server is restricted to only known (and presumably trusted) users.

  Scenario: List users
    Given user has the "player" role
    And logged in
    When getting the users
    Then MC serves the users page
    And the response is a list of users
    And the list of users has at least one user
    
  Scenario Outline: Login
    # Implicitly not logged in
    Given user has the "player" role
    When log in using correct password
    Then MC accepts the login
    
  Scenario Outline: Add user
    Given user has the "manage-users" role
    And logged in
    When adding a user named "<new-name>" with  password "<password>"
    Then MC accepts the addition
    And can get the list of users
    And the list of users includes a user named "<new-name>"
    
    Examples:
      |name|new-name|password|
      |Andrew|John|letmein|
      |Zoes|Jeff|password123|
    
  Scenario Outline: Only administrator may add user
    Given user does not have the "manage-users" role
    And logged in
    Then MC does not present adding a user as an option
