Feature: Unknown Resource
  Attempts to access unknown or incorrectly named things should give useful error responses.

  @back-end
  Scenario Outline: Get unknown resource
    # Implicitly a fresh instance of MC
    # Implicitly not logged in
    When getting the unknown resource at "<path>"
    Then MC replies with Not Found

    Examples: 
      |path|
      |/xxxxx|
      |/players|

  @integration
  Scenario Outline: Modify unknown resource
    # Implicitly a fresh instance of MC
    # Implicitly not logged in
    When modifying the unknown resource with a "<verb>" at "<path>"
    Then MC replies with Not Found or Forbidden or Method Not Allowed
    # The precise HTTP status code is determined by the ingress, rather than MC proper,
    # and does not matter in practice to a user using a browser.

    Examples: 
      |verb|path|
      |POST|/xxxxx|
      |PUT|/players|
      |DELETE|/players|
