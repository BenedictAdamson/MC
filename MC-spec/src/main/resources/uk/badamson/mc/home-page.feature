Feature: Home-page
  It should be easy for users to access the home-page of an MC server, and know they have got the right page.

  Scenario: Potential user accesses an MC server using a simple URL with the root path
    Given the DNS name, example.com, of an MC server
    And not logged in
    # Implicitly: And not resuming a session
    When the potential user gives the obvious URL http://example.com/ to a web browser
    Then MC serves the home page
    And the home page title includes the name of the game
    And the home page header includes the name of the game
    And MC allows logging in
    And MC does not allow logout
    And MC does not allow examining the current user
